        <p>‚ÄúNothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. The slogan ‚ÄòPress On‚Äô has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.‚Äù ‚ÄîCalvin Coolidge.</p>
